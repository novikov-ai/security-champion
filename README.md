# Becoming a [Security Champion](https://owasp.org/www-project-security-culture/v10/4-Security_Champions/)

Security Champions act as a single point of contact in regards to security for their team. The Security Champion is in contact with a member of the security team to ask for guidance. The Security Champion can monitor security best practices, and help the security team run and promote security uplift activities such as a CTF (Capture the Flag) event.

Security Champions help to improve the communication between the development teams and the security team. A Security Champion will know the pain points of their teammates' code bases and culture, they are then in a good position to present security in a way that directly connects with them. Security Champions are a key element of improving application security maturity as referenced in maturity frameworks such as OWASP SAMM.
